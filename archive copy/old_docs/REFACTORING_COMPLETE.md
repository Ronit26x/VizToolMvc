# MVC Refactoring Complete ✅

## Summary

The VizTool codebase has been successfully refactored from a monolithic architecture to a clean Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. All functionality has been preserved while improving maintainability, testability, and code organization.

## What Changed

### Files Modified
1. **index.html** - Added MVC initialization script that runs before main.js
2. **js/main.js** - Completely refactored (1665 lines → 1376 lines) to use MVC pattern

### Files Created
1. **js/core/EventEmitter.js** (5.1 KB) - Event system with cycle prevention
2. **js/core/GraphModel.js** (12 KB) - Single source of truth for graph data
3. **js/core/GraphView.js** (7.0 KB) - Rendering and DOM event handling
4. **js/core/GraphController.js** (7.8 KB) - Mediates Model and View
5. **js/core/LayoutManager.js** (6.7 KB) - D3 force simulation with dampening
6. **js/core/LegacyBridge.js** (3.4 KB) - Adapter for gradual migration (not used in final implementation)

### Files Backed Up
- **js/main.old.js** - Original 1665-line main.js (safe backup for rollback)

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Monolithic)
```
main.js (1665 lines)
├── Global state variables
├── D3 simulation setup
├── Canvas rendering
├── Event handlers
├── UI updates
├── Complex operations
└── Utility functions
```

### After (MVC)
```
index.html
└── MVC Initialization Script
    ├── GraphModel (state management)
    ├── GraphView (rendering + DOM events)
    ├── GraphController (coordination)
    └── LayoutManager (D3 simulation)

main.js (1376 lines)
├── Waits for MVC initialization
├── Application setup
├── UI event handlers → Controller
├── MVC event listeners → UI updates
└── Legacy operations (sync with Model)
```

## Key Features Preserved

✅ **File Loading**
- DOT format parsing and loading
- GFA format parsing and loading
- Auto-detection of format

✅ **Graph Operations**
- Generate random graphs
- Node selection (single/multiple)
- Drag and drop nodes
- Pin/unpin nodes
- Zoom and pan canvas
- Reset view

✅ **GFA-Specific Features**
- Node flipping with orientation
- Red/green subnode visualization
- Physical resolution based on subnodes

✅ **Vertex Resolution**
- Logical resolution (source → target)
- Physical resolution (red/green subnodes)
- Interactive path selection dialog
- Automatic path updates after resolution

✅ **Node Merging**
- Linear chain detection from selected node
- Automatic chain merging (non-branching nodes)
- Preserves external connections
- Path updates after merge
- Merged sequence export

✅ **Path Management**
- Save paths with custom names
- Quick view (temporary highlight)
- Navigate between paths
- Import paths from file
- Export all paths to file
- Export path sequences
- Path updates after graph changes
- Visual path highlighting with colors

✅ **History**
- Undo functionality
- 20-entry history limit

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
```javascript
// Model emits events when state changes
model.updateNodePosition(nodeId, x, y, 'drag');
// → Emits 'nodeMoved' event

// View listens and re-renders
model.on('nodeMoved', () => {
  view.render();
});
```

### 2. Cycle Prevention
```javascript
// Events tagged with source to prevent infinite loops
layoutManager.on('nodeMoved', ({ source }) => {
  if (source === 'layout') return; // Ignore own events
  // Update layout
});
```

### 3. Dampening System
- **Time-based**: 16ms minimum between emits (~60fps)
- **Distance-based**: 0.5px threshold for position updates
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders and improves performance

### 4. Clean Separation of Concerns
- **Model**: Pure data, no DOM knowledge
- **View**: Rendering only, emits user actions
- **Controller**: Logic coordination, no direct rendering
- **LayoutManager**: Algorithm logic, updates Model

## How It Works

### Initialization Flow
```
1. Browser loads index.html
2. MVC initialization script runs
   → Creates Model, View, LayoutManager, Controller
   → Stores in window.graphApp
3. main.js loads and waits for MVC
4. Once ready, main.js initializes application
   → Sets up UI handlers
   → Subscribes to Model events
   → Sets up legacy operations
```

### Event Flow Example (Node Drag)
```
1. User drags node on canvas
2. View detects mousemove
3. View emits 'nodeDrag' event with {nodeId, x, y}
4. Controller receives event
5. Controller updates Model: model.updateNodePosition(nodeId, x, y, 'drag')
6. Model emits 'nodeMoved' event
7. LayoutManager receives event, boosts simulation
8. View receives event, re-renders canvas
```
