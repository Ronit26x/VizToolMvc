# Node Merge Fix - October 2025

## Problem

The linear chain merge functionality stopped working after the MVC refactoring. When users clicked "Merge Linear Chain", nothing happened or errors occurred.

## Root Cause

The issue was in `js/node-merger.js`, specifically in the `buildNodeConnections()` function and related helper functions. The problem had two parts:

### 1. Inconsistent Node ID Handling

The merge logic was not consistently normalizing node IDs throughout the chain detection process. After D3's force simulation processes links, it converts:

```javascript
// From this (fresh from parser):
{ source: "1", target: "2" }

// To this (after D3 simulation):
{ source: nodeObjectRef, target: nodeObjectRef }
```

The code was extracting IDs in some places but not others, causing mismatches in the connection map lookups.

### 2. Missing Null-Safe Access

The original code used:
```javascript
const sourceId = normalizeNodeId(link.source.id || link.source);
```

This would fail when `link.source` was a string (not an object), because `"1".id` would be `undefined`, but the `|| link.source` fallback would still work. However, it wasn't using optional chaining, so if `link.source` was `null` or `undefined`, it would crash.

## Solution

Applied consistent ID normalization throughout all functions:

### Changes Made

1. **buildNodeConnections()** - Updated to use proper null-safe access:
```javascript
// Before
const sourceId = normalizeNodeId(link.source.id || link.source);

// After
const sourceId = normalizeNodeId(
  link.source?.id !== undefined ? link.source.id : link.source
);
```

2. **getLinearPreviousNode()** - Added ID normalization:
```javascript
// Before
const conn = connections.get(currentNode.id);

// After
const currentId = normalizeNodeId(currentNode.id);
const conn = connections.get(currentId);
```

3. **getLinearNextNode()** - Added ID normalization (same pattern as above)

4. **isLinearOrEndpointNode()** - Added ID normalization:
```javascript
// Before
const conn = connections.get(nodeId);

// After
const normalizedId = normalizeNodeId(nodeId);
const conn = connections.get(normalizedId);
```

5. **findLinearChain()** - Normalized IDs for visited set:
```javascript
// Before
const visitedIds = new Set([startNode.id]);

// After
const startNodeId = normalizeNodeId(startNode.id);
const visitedIds = new Set([startNodeId]);

// And when adding to visited:
visitedIds.add(normalizeNodeId(prevNode.id));
```

6. **Added debug logging** to help diagnose future issues:
```javascript
console.log(`Total nodes in graph: ${nodes.length}`);
console.log(`Total links in graph: ${links.length}`);
console.log(`Sample link structure:`, links[0]);
```

## Testing

The fix ensures that:

1. ‚úÖ Linear chains are correctly detected regardless of how links are structured
2. ‚úÖ Connection counting works with both string IDs and object references
3. ‚úÖ Cycle detection works correctly with normalized IDs
4. ‚úÖ Branching nodes are correctly identified and rejected
5. ‚úÖ Debug output helps identify future issues

## Files Modified

- `js/node-merger.js` - All chain detection and connection analysis functions

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. Load a GFA or DOT file with linear chains
2. Select any node in a linear path (‚â§2 total connections)
3. Click "Merge Linear Chain"
4. The chain should be automatically detected and merged
5. Check console for detailed debug logs showing the chain detection process

## Example Console Output (Success)

```

## Technical Notes

The `normalizeNodeId()` function (defined at the bottom of node-merger.js) simply converts any ID to a trimmed string:

```javascript
function normalizeNodeId(nodeId) {
  return String(nodeId).trim();
}
```

This ensures that:
- Numeric IDs (e.g., `1`) and string IDs (e.g., `"1"`) are treated as identical
- Leading/trailing whitespace doesn't cause mismatches
- Object lookups in Maps work consistently

## Related Issues

This fix resolves the interface mismatch described in:
- `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` - Section 2: Operations (BLOCKED)
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Interface incompatibility section

The legacy operations still work with plain objects (arrays of nodes/links), which is what the MVC model provides via its getter methods.
