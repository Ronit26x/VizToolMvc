# Node Merger Migration Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

## Summary

Successfully migrated node merging functionality from legacy implementation to MVC architecture. The legacy `node-merger.js` has been deprecated and archived.

## What Changed

### ✅ New Files Created

1. **`/js/operations/NodeMerger.js`** (MVC Operation)
   - Main merging logic using MVC architecture
   - Uses GraphAdapter to work with GraphModel
   - Follows Operation pattern (reversible, with history)

2. **`/js/operations/node-merger-utils.js`** (Utility Functions)
   - `isMergedNode()` - Check if node is merged
   - `getMergedNodeInfo()` - Get merged node information
   - `exportMergedNodeSequence()` - Export merged node sequence
   - `updatePathsAfterMerge()` - Update paths after merge

3. **`/js/core/GraphAdapter.js`** (Already existed)
   - Bridge between Graph class interface and GraphModel
   - Allows NodeMerger to work with plain arrays

### ✅ Files Updated

1. **`/js/main.js`**
   - **Before**: `import { ... } from './node-merger.js';`
   - **After**: `import { ... } from './operations/node-merger-utils.js';`
   - Now uses `NodeMerger` operation for merging
   - Uses utility functions for helper operations

2. **`/js/core/GraphController.js`**
   - Added listener for `nodesMerged` event
   - Calls `view.invalidateGfaNodes()` to force GFA renderer cache refresh

3. **`/js/core/GraphView.js`**
   - Added `invalidateGfaNodes()` method
   - Clears `_gfaNodes` cache when graph structure changes

### ✅ Files Archived

1. **`/archive/old_implementation/node-merger.js`**
   - Original legacy implementation (681 lines)
   - Kept for reference but no longer used

### ❌ Files Removed

1. **`/js/operations/node-merger-bridge.js`**
   - Temporary bridge file (no longer needed)
   - Deleted since we went straight to MVC

## Architecture Now

### Data Flow

```
User clicks "Merge Linear Chain"
    ↓
main.js creates GraphAdapter + NodeMerger
    ↓
NodeMerger.execute():
  - Finds linear chain (connection counting)
  - Collects external edges
  - Creates merged node
  - Creates new edges
    ↓
GraphAdapter.mergeNodes() → GraphModel.mergeNodes()
    ↓
GraphModel:
  - Removes original nodes
  - Removes their links
  - Adds merged node
  - Adds new edges
  - Emits 'nodesMerged' event
    ↓
Event Listeners:
  ├─ LayoutManager: Updates D3 simulation
  ├─ GraphController: Invalidates GFA cache, updates view
  └─ GraphView: Recreates GfaNode objects, renders
    ↓
✅ Merged node appears with edges visible!
```

## Key Differences: Legacy vs MVC

| Aspect | Legacy node-merger.js | MVC NodeMerger.js |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Interface** | `mergeLinearChainFromNode(node, nodes[], links[])` | `new NodeMerger(graphAdapter, nodeId).execute()` |
| **Architecture** | Standalone functions | Operation class (OOP) |
| **Data Access** | Direct array manipulation | Through GraphAdapter interface |
| **History** | Manual (caller handles) | Automatic (Operation base class) |
| **Events** | None | Emits `nodesMerged` via GraphModel |
| **Reversible** | No | Yes (Operation.reverse()) |
| **Algorithm** | Connection counting | Same (connection counting) |
| **Lines of Code** | 681 | 516 (NodeMerger) + 145 (utils) |

## Algorithm Preserved

The core merging algorithm remains **exactly the same**:

### Linear Chain Detection
1. **Connection Counting**: Node with ≤2 total connections (incoming + outgoing) is linear
2. **Branching Detection**: Node with >2 connections is a branch point
3. **Bidirectional Tracing**: Trace backwards and forwards until hitting endpoints or branches

### For GFA Graphs
- Uses **physical connections** (red/green subnodes)
- Respects orientation markers (`+` / `-`)
- Maps chain ends to merged node orientations:
  - Start of chain (red end) → `-` orientation
  - End of chain (green end) → `+` orientation

### For DOT Graphs
- Uses **logical connections** (source→target)
- No orientation markers

## Benefits Achieved

✅ **Cleaner Architecture**: Follows MVC pattern
✅ **Better Separation**: Operation logic separate from utilities
✅ **Event-Driven**: GraphModel emits events, listeners respond
✅ **Reversible**: Operation can be undone
✅ **Type Safety**: Graph interface defined by GraphAdapter
✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All functionality preserved
✅ **Same Algorithm**: Connection counting logic unchanged

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Node merging works (edges visible)
- [x] Linear chain detection works
- [x] GFA orientation handling works
- [x] DOT format works
- [x] External edges preserved correctly
- [x] D3 force simulation updates
- [x] GFA renderer cache invalidates
- [x] Merged node info displays
- [x] Sequence export works
- [x] Path updates work
- [x] Undo works (via Operation history)

## Known Issues

None! The migration is complete and working.

## Future Migrations

The following legacy files can be migrated next:

1. **sequence-exporter.js** → `operations/SequenceExporter.js`
2. **path-updater.js** → `operations/PathManager.js`
3. **gfa-renderer.js** → `view/renderers/GfaRenderer.js` (needs feature parity)

## Conclusion

✅ Node merger successfully migrated to MVC architecture
✅ Legacy file archived for reference
✅ All functionality working correctly
✅ Code is cleaner and more maintainable
