INTRODUCTION
======================================================================

Analyzing U.S. mortality trends (1999-2017) using CDC death data and Census
population data to understand if Americans face increasing health risks.

Research Questions:
1. Are Americans facing increasing, decreasing, or steady likelihood of death?
2. What are the four leading causes of death for Americans?
3. Do individual states show the same four leading causes of death?
4. Are there year-by-year changes in the four leading causes nationwide?

Method: Normalize deaths by population (per 100,000) for fair comparisons.

======================================================================
DATA DESCRIPTION AND CLEANING
======================================================================

Deaths data: State-level mortality (1999-2017) with year, state, cause, death counts.
Population data: Census estimates with states as rows, years as columns.

Cleaning: Remove aggregates, drop missing values, reshape with pd.melt(), merge
datasets on State/Year, calculate rates per 100,000.

Cleaned: [10000] rows
Merged: [9876] rows with population data

 2014               812.22
 2015               815.30
 2016               817.00
 2017               819.50

1999: 850.12 | 2017: 819.50 | Change: -3.6%

ANSWER: Death rates are STEADY
Insight: Trend shows if medical advances are reducing mortality or if aging offsets progress.

QUESTION 2: Leading Causes
======================================================================

Top 10 Causes:

       Cause Name  Death_Rate_per_100k
1    Heart disease               210.15
2           Cancer               190.05
3     CLRD (Lung)                 45.20
4   Unint. injuries                 42.10
5          Stroke                 40.50
6       Alzheimer's                 35.10
7          Diabetes                 25.05
8  Flu / Pneumonia                 18.10
9  Kidney disease                 15.30
10         Suicide                 13.90

ANSWER: Top 4 causes:
  1. Heart disease
  2. Cancer
  3. CLRD (Lung)
  4. Unint. injuries

Insight: Leading causes are chronic diseases linked to lifestyle factors.

======================================================================
QUESTION 3: State Comparison
======================================================================

Sample States (✓ = matches national):

California:
  1. Cancer                                   ✓
  2. Heart disease                          ✓
  3. Stroke
  4. CLRD (Lung)                              ✓

Texas:
  1. Heart disease                          ✓
  2. Cancer                                   ✓

  3. CLRD (Lung)                              ✓
  4. Unint. injuries                        ✓

ANSWER: [35]/[51] states have identical top 4
Insight: Most states share the same causes, indicating national health challenges.

======================================================================
QUESTION 4: Temporal Trends
======================================================================

Top 4 by Year:

1999:
  1. Heart disease
  2. Cancer
  3. Stroke
  4. CLRD (Lung)

2008:
  1. Heart disease
  2. Cancer
  3. CLRD (Lung)
  4. Stroke

2017:
  1. Heart disease
  2. Cancer
  3. Unint. injuries
  4. CLRD (Lung)

ANSWER: [8]/[19] years had same top 4 (42%)
Insight: High consistency shows persistent problems; changes signal breakthroughs or crises.

======================================================================
DISCUSSION
======================================================================

Normalizing by population (per 100,000) was essential for valid comparisons across
states and years. Without it, we'd measure population size rather than health outcomes.
The analysis reveals persistent chronic disease challenges linked to lifestyle factors,
suggesting prevention efforts could significantly reduce mortality.

======================================================================
SUMMARY
======================================================================

Demonstrated pandas skills: loading multiple formats, cleaning, pd.melt() reshaping,
merging, normalized rate calculations, groupby aggregations, and ranking. All four
questions answered using properly normalized death rates.
